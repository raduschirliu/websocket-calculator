[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/17568ee7-2a41-4050-8e0e-f75e7a8149de/deploy-status)](https://rs-ws-calculator.netlify.app/)  
Simple real-time WebSocket calculator built in TypeScript using a React frontend and a Node.js backend.  
Calculations being made are shared with all current active users of the web app, and the results also persist between sessions by using the user's local storage.  
  
Demo can be found [here](https://rs-ws-calculator.netlify.app/), and is hosted on Heroku and Netlify.  
Instructions on running the frontend & backend are in the `frontend` and `backend` folders.
